JAXB Utilities
==============

Bits and pieces I use in both personal and work projects whenever I need to
manipulate XML via JAXB.

 - Current version: 1.2.6
 - Release date: 5 September 2013

Minimum Requirements
--------------------

 - Java 6
 - JAXB 2.2 (2.2.7 and its dependencies included)
 - Joda Time 2.x (optional dependency, required if using any of the Joda Time)
   adapters ([XMLDateTimeAdapter](#xmldatetimeadapter), [XMLLocalDateAdapter](#xmllocaldateadapter))


Installation
------------

### Standalone distribution
Copy the JAR from [the latest download bundle](https://github.com/ultraq/jaxb-utilities/releases/download/JAXB-Utilities-1.2.6/JAXB.Utilities.1.2.6.zip),
or build the project from the source code here on GitHub.

### For Maven and Maven-compatible dependency managers
Add a dependency to your project with the following co-ordinates:

 - GroupId: `nz.net.ultraq.jaxb`
 - ArtifactId: `jaxb-utilities`
 - Version: `1.2.6`


Marshalling/Unmarshalling
-------------------------

### XMLReader

Wraps the job of unmarshalling XML content into a Java object, adding methods
for enabling validation against a schema or schemas during unmarshalling.

Example usage:

```java
XMLReader<YourClass> xmlReader = new XMLReader<>(YourClass.class);
xmlReader.addValidatingSchema(new File("YourSchema.xsd"));
YourClass instance = xmlReader.readXMLData(source);
```


### XMLWriter

Wraps the job of marshalling Java objects back into XML files, adding methods
for enabling CDATA sections, mapping namespaces to custom prefixes, and
validating against a schema or schemas during marshalling.

Example usage:

```java
XMLWriter<YourClass> xmlWriter = new XMLWriter<>(YourClass.class);
xmlWriter.setFormatOutput(true);
xmlWriter.writeXMLData(instance, new File("Output.xml"));
```


Adapters
--------

### XMLCDataAdapter

Used in conjunction with `XMLWriter` and its `setUseCDATASections()` method,
causes JAXB to write CDATA sections instead of the usual XML-escaped strings
that it produces.  Handy when your string content contains lots of XML-reserved
characters (eg: HTML or XML content).

To generate classes from a schema that use this adapter, annotate the string
property you want to be converted into a CDATA-aware string instead:

```xml
<xsd:element name="html-content" type="xsd:string">
  <xsd:annotation>
    <xsd:appinfo>
      <jxb:property>
        <xjc:javaType
          adapter="nz.net.ultraq.jaxb.adapters.XMLCDataAdapter"
          name="java.lang.String"/>
      </jxb:property>
    </xsd:appinfo>
  </xsd:annotation>
</xsd:element>
```

Alternatively, to have JAXB write CDATA sections into XML files from your
existing Java classes, annotate the string property like so:

```java
@XmlJavaTypeAdapter(XMLCDataAdapter.class)
protected String htmlContent;
```

Then, set the `XMLWriter` to output CDATA sections:

```java
XMLWriter<YourClass> xmlWriter = new XMLWriter<>();
xmlWriter.setUseCDATASections(true);
```

The next time you use one of `XMLWriter`'s `writeXMLData` methods, the resulting
XML will wrap the element you've annotated in a CDATA section:

```xml
<html-content><![CDATA[
  I'm an element containing <html> content, but I <i>won't</i> get
  escaped because this is a CDATA section
]]></html-content>
```


### XMLDateTimeAdapter

Marshal/unmarshal XML dates/times to the [Joda](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/)
`DateTime` object.

To generate classes from a schema that use this adapter, annotate the XML date/time
property you want to be converted into a Joda `DateTime` instead:

```xml
<xsd:element name="date" type="xsd:date">
  <xsd:annotation>
    <xsd:appinfo>
      <jxb:property>
        <xjc:javaType
          adapter="nz.net.ultraq.jaxb.adapters.XMLDateTimeAdapter"
          name="org.joda.time.DateTime"/>
      </jxb:property>
    </xsd:appinfo>
  </xsd:annotation>
</xsd:element>
```

Alternatively, to have existing Java classes that use Joda `DateTime` map to XML
date/time, annotate your date properties like so:

```java
@XmlJavaTypeAdapter(XMLDateTimeAdapter.class)
@XmlSchemaType(name = "date")
private DateTime date;
```


### XMLLocalDateAdapter

Similar usage to the `[XMLDateTimeAdapter](#xmldatetimeadapter)`, just swap `XMLDateTimeAdapter`
for `XMLLocalDateAdapter`.


Changelog
---------

### 1.2.6
 - Thanks once again to [David Karlsen](https://github.com/davidkarlsen) for
   making the `XmlDateTimeAdapter` marshall correctly and support a wider
   variety of ISO 8601 date/time formats in the process ([#7](https://github.com/ultraq/jaxb-utilities/pull/7)).

### 1.2.5
 - Big thanks to [David Karlsen](https://github.com/davidkarlsen), who is
   basically responsible for everything that happened in this release :)
 - Added a new adapter, `XMLLocalDateAdapter`.  Similar to the `XMLDateTimeAdapter`,
   but returns a Joda `LocalDate` object instead (#1, #3).
 - Upgraded Joda Time optional dependency to 2.3 (#4)
 - Added the repository to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ultraq/jaxb-utilities).

### 1.2.4
 - Made the Joda Time dependency optional, which should help reduce overall
   package size for projects that don't need the [XmlDateTimeAdapter](#xmldatetimeadapter).
 - Removed P2 repository generation introduced in the last version (it wasn't
   used in the end and didn't solve the plugin dependency problem).

### 1.2.3
 - Added Apache License 2.0 information to the project.
 - Added use of the [p2-maven-plugin](https://github.com/reficio/p2-maven-plugin)
   to generate a P2 repository for this project so it can be referenced in
   Eclipse plugin builds (namely the [Thymeleaf Extras Eclipse Plugin](https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-extras-eclipse-plugin)).

### 1.2.2
 - Updated activation JAR dependency.
 - Minor fixes from the updated [maven-support](https://github.com/ultraq/gradle-support)
   Gradle script.
 - Minor readme changes.

### 1.2.1
 - Switched from Ant to Gradle as a build tool.
 - Made project available from Maven Central.  Maven co-ordinates added to the
   [Installation](#installation) section.

### 1.2
 - Initial GitHub version.
